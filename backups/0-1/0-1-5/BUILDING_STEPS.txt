# Building Steps for Simple Drawing App

## Step 1: Initialize the App
- Display the app title and a 1000x1000 canvas.
- Create the following files:
  - index.html
  - src/js/app.js
  - src/js/canvas.js
  - src/js/utils.js
- Ensure the canvas is initialized and displayed correctly.

## Step 2: Add Line Drawing
- Implement basic line drawing functionality in Click to Draw mode.
- Add event listeners for `mousedown` and `mousemove` in `canvas.js`.
- Use `utils.js` for reusable functions like drawing lines.

## Step 3: Add Snapping Features
- Implement Snap to Grid, Snap to Midpoint, and Snap to Endpoint.
- Use `utils.js` for snapping logic.

## Step 4: Add Line Selection
- Allow users to select a line by clicking on it.
- Display grips at the start and end points of the selected line.

## Step 5: Add Properties Window
- Display the properties of the selected line in a draggable window.
- Update the properties dynamically when a new line is selected.

## Step 6: Add Combined Snapping
- Ensure all snapping features work together with the correct priority:
  1. Snap to Endpoint
  2. Snap to Midpoint
  3. Snap to Grid

## Step 7: Finalize and Test
- Test all features individually and in combination.
- Update the documentation and functionality log.
